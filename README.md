# Indonesia Tourism Data Analysis

## Overview
This project explores tourism trends across five major cities in Indonesia: Jakarta, Yogyakarta, Bandung, Semarang, and Surabaya. The analysis focuses on the distribution of ratings and prices for various categories of tourist sites in each city, while examining how tourist preferences differ based on age and travel habits.

**Note:** This dataset is dummy data and does not represent real-world tourism statistics. The analysis is hypothetical and is used to demonstrate how a tourism recommendation system could work.

## Objective
The goal of this project is to:
- Analyze the average price and rating distribution of tourist attractions by city and category.
- Explore relationships between age groups, travel preferences, and pricing.
- Provide insights into potential tourism patterns and consumer behavior for hypothetical decision-making.

## Key Insights
1. **Price vs Rating:**
   - **Jakarta** has the **highest average prices** for tourist attractions but relatively **lower ratings**. Conversely, **Yogyakarta** offers **lower prices** but achieves the **highest ratings**, indicating that **value for money** is an important factor in tourist satisfaction.
   
2. **City Comparisons:**
   - **Bandung** and **Surabaya** offer moderately priced attractions but maintain relatively high ratings, making them attractive destinations for tourists seeking a balance of cost and quality.
   - **Semarang** and **Yogyakarta** are the most **budget-friendly** cities with high ratings, appealing to price-conscious travelers.

3. **Category Comparisons:**
   - **Theme Parks** and **Shopping Centers** are the most expensive categories, but **Theme Parks** consistently receive higher ratings, suggesting tourists find them worth the premium price.
   - **Natural and Cultural Sites** offer a good balance between **moderate prices** and **high ratings**, providing quality experiences at a reasonable cost.
   - **Religious Sites** are the **least expensive** category, but still receive positive ratings, likely due to their cultural importance.

4. **Tourism Behavior by Age:**
   - From the **line chart in the dashboard**, the data shows that **older tourists tend to pay more** for their experiences but **travel less** time to reach their destinations. This suggests that older travelers prioritize comfort and are willing to spend more for convenience.
   - **Younger tourists**, on the other hand, are more willing to travel farther distances in search of budget-friendly options.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Data Preparation:** R
- **Visualization:** Tableau
- **Data Analysis:** Bar charts to analyze the distribution of ratings and prices by city and category, and a line chart to understand how age influences travel preferences.
- **Mapping:** A map visualizing tourist behavior by age group.

## Dataset
This project uses **dummy data** sourced from a fictional tourism dataset that simulates various tourist attractions and user preferences. The dataset includes:
- Tourist attraction information across five cities.
- User data, including preferences and ratings.
- Travel package details and recommended places based on cost, time, and user preferences.

The dataset is sourced from [this app](https://github.com/AgungP88/getloc-apps) and is used for demonstration purposes only.

## Project Structure
1. **Data Visualization**
   - **Bar Charts:** Displaying average price and rating by city and category.
   - **Line Chart:** Showing how age impacts both the price paid and the time traveled to tourist attractions.
   - **Tourism Map:** Visualizing the preferences of different age groups for various tourist attractions.

2. **Key Metrics Explored**
   - **Average Prices**: Analyzing how prices vary across different cities and categories.
   - **Average Ratings**: Exploring which cities and categories have the highest tourist satisfaction.
   - **Tourist Behavior**: Understanding how different age groups impact spending and travel time.

## Conclusion
This hypothetical analysis highlights the **importance of value for money** and **tourist satisfaction**. By understanding the hypothetical pricing, ratings, and travel preferences of different age groups, tourism businesses can tailor their offerings to meet the diverse needs of various demographics, providing both premium and budget-friendly experiences.
